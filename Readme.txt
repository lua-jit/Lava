LAVA (better name pending)
==========================

Lava is going to be a simple 2D game engine that's simple and quick.
I'm aiming for this engine to implement the same features as GameMaker 8.

This means simple interfaces to 
animated sprites, audio, backgrounds, 
keyboard/controller input and timelines.

Currently working on:
	- Virtual filesystem [don't want all games to ship with a raw folder of assets]
	- Basic audio interface [oneshots and music loops]
